# Contributing

Read `GLOBAL_GOAL.md`, `REPOSITORY_ROLE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` before proposing changes.

## Change process

1. Inspect `git status --short` and preserve unrelated work.
2. Explain affected Windows APIs, core/localization compatibility, package identity, privacy, accessibility, and lifecycle behavior.
3. Keep changes native and focused; do not move core behavior into the Windows client.
4. Run `./tools/check-foundation.sh` at the current checkpoint.
5. Once the solution exists, run every available command in `docs/testing.md` on a supported Windows toolchain.
6. Record actual build and test evidence in `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`.

Use short imperative commit subjects with an optional scope, for example `windows: define core event owner`.

Pull requests must describe user-visible behavior, tests, core and localization versions, package or data-flow changes, rollback impact, and exact validation results. Include screenshots for UI changes and accessibility evidence where applicable. Never include credentials or private user content.
